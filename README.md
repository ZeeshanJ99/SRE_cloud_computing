**SRE introduction**
- What is the role of SRE?
The role of an SRE is to create a bridge between devops through applying a CICD mindset. 
They can ensure that projects develop and evolve smoothly from start to finish.
SREs need to understand the resilience measures of their service and know when those measures will be insufficient at a future point of time and will need maintenance. 


**Cloud Computing**
- What is Cloud Computing and the benefits of using it?

Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet, including data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. 
Cloud-based storage makes it possible to save files to a remote database and retrieve them on demand
The benefits include cost saving - easy access saves money and time in project startups, security- 94% of businesses saw an improvement in security (rapid scale) also dont need to employ your own security, mobility- by relying on an outside organisation you have more time to focus upon other parts of the business, insight - is able to provide information about users. scale on demand - cost effective.

AWS can be used to store critical data. It offers multiple types of storage to choose from, allowing businesses to make their own decisions based on their needs.

**What is SDLC and stages of SDLC**
- What is SDLC and what are the stages of it

Software Development Life Cycle is a process for planning, creating, testing and deploying an information system
The seven new stages: planning, analysis, design, development, testing, implementation, and maintenance.

**What are the Risk level at each stage of SDLC?**

- LOW - planning, analysis, design
- Medium- development, testing
- High - implementation, maintenence
